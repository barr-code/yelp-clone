Week 8 project at [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com).
We are tasked with building a [Yelp](http://www.yelp.com) clone following [this tutorial](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/yelp.md).

We'll be building our Yelp clone using Ruby on Rails, using a Postgres database and testing in Rspec and Capybara.
